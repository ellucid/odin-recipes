        <p>A recipe by Kat Boytsova</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Makes one 9" cake</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  3/4  cup vegetable oil, plus more for pan</li>
            <li>1 1/3  cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4  cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 3/4  tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>  1/4  tsp. baking sode</li>
            <li>1 1/2  tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>  1/2  cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>    2  large eggs</li>
            <li>    1  cup milk</li>
            <li>1 3/4  tsp. vanilla extract, divided</li>
            <li>    4  oz. semisweet chocolate chips or coarsely chopped chocolate</li>
            <li>  1/2  cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>    4  oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>  1/4  cup powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Place a rack in center of oven and preheat to 325Â°. Grease the
                    bottom and sides of a 9" roundcake pan with vegetable oil. Using</p>
                <p>the bottom of the cake pan, outline a circle of parchment paper
                    to cut and place it in the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Combine all the dry ingredients - 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
                    1 3/4 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. baking soda, 1 1/4 tsp.</p>
                <p>kosher salt - and 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar in a large bowl.
                    Sift in 1/2 cup cocoa powder, and whisk to combine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Whisk 2 eggs, 3/4 cup vehetable oil, and 1 tsp.vanilla extract
                    in a medium bowl for about 30 seconds. The mixture should be</p>
                <p>Smooth and glossy. With a spatula, mix the egg mixture into
                    the dry ingredients until fully homogenous. It may appear thick</p>
                <p>and pasty.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Over medium heat, warm up 1 cup milk in a small saucepan. It
                    should not boil, but rather simmer. Whisk the milk into the batter</p>
                <p>until just combined. It should be lump-free, but don't overmix</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer the batter to prepared pan. Tap the pan against the
                    surface to eliminate bubbles. Bake cake for 40-50 minutes,</p>
                <p>(rotating half-way through), or until the cake-tester/tooth-pick
                    clean when inserted into the center. Transfer to wire rack to cool</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While the cake is baking, make the frosting. Fill a meduim pot
                    and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. In a medium heatproof</p>
                <p>bowl, combine 4 ox. chocolate chips and 1/2 cup heavy cream.
                    Place the bowl over the saucepan, reducing the heat to low, and</p>
                <p>stir frequently until chocolate is melted and mixture is homogenous.
                    Chill ganache until cool (~25 minutes). Alternatively, melt the</p>
                <p>chocolate and cream mix in the microwave with 10-second bursts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Combine 4 oz. room-temperature cream cheese, 1/4 cup powdered
                    sugar, and remaining 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. kosher</p>
                <p>salt in a large bowl. With a electric mixer on medium-high speed,
                    whisk the ingredients until no lumps remain and texture is smooth.</p>
                <p>Beat in cooled chocolate ganache on medium speed until frosting
                    peaks just holds its shape (~1 min). Do not overmix, or frosting</p>
                <p>will become too stiff.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove the cake from the pan and invert it onto a plate. Spread
                    the ganache evenly over the cakes surface.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
